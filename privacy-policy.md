**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the Vaani app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Dr. Blank (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**Information Collection and Use**

The Application does not collect any information by itself. It is a client for a self-hosted server, meaning that users are responsible for setting up their own servers to use the Application. Any information collected will be by the user's server and not by the Service Provider.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-10-01

**Your Consent**

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at drblankdev@gmail.com.
